# CcLBD25_project
These R scripts that were used in the project: CcLBD25 functions as a key regulator of haustorium development in Cuscuta campestris.

We used these scripts following this order:
1.MDS
2.PCA
3.SOM

After SOM clustering, we selected candidate clusters and used these genes to construct gene co-expression networks by using the GCN script.
