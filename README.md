# CcLBD25_project

Welcome! This Min-Yao's repository for CcLBD25 project.
These R scripts were used in the project: [CcLBD25 functions as a key regulator of haustorium development in Cuscuta campestris](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425251)

We used these scripts following this order:
#### 1. MDS (Multidimensional scaling)
#### 2. PCA (Principal component analysis)
#### 3. SOM (Self-organizing map)

After SOM clustering, we selected candidate clusters and used these genes to construct gene co-expression networks (GCN) by using the 'GCN' script.

#### 4. GCN (gene co-expression network)

This GCN script is modified from Hokuto Nakayama's previously published R script for RNA-Seq gene coexpression network analysis deposited on GitHub (Link: https://github.com/Hokuto-GH/gene-coexpression-network-script).
