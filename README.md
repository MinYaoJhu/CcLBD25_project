# CcLBD25_project

Welcome! This Min-Yao's repository for CcLBD25 project.
These R scripts were used in the project: [CcLBD25 functions as a key regulator of haustorium development in Cuscuta campestris](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425251)

We used these scripts following this order:
#### 1. MDS
#### 2. PCA
#### 3. SOM

After SOM clustering, we selected candidate clusters and used these genes to construct gene co-expression networks by using the GCN script.
